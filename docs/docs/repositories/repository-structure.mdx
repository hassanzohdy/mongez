title: Repository Structure
---

## Introduction

In this section, we'll discover the structure of a generated repository file.

:::info Note
This structure is a bias one regardless the database engine used in the project.
:::

## A typical repository file structure

The following example illustrates the repository structure regardless the database engine type.

Please note that this structure is used as an easier alternative for `create` `update` `list` methods.

```php title="UsersRepository.php"
<?php

namespace App\Modules\Users\Repositories;

use App\Modules\Users\{
    Models\User,
    Resources\UserResource,
    Filters\UsersFilter
};

use HZ\Illuminate\Mongez\{

    Managers\Database\MongoDB\RepositoryManager
};

class UsersRepository extends RepositoryManager implements RepositoryInterface

     *
     * @param   mixed $model
     * @param   \Illuminate\Http\Request $request

     */
    protected function setData($model, $request)
    {
        //
    }

    protected function filter()

    }
}
```

## Repository Design Base

Any generated repository defines list of constants and methods automatically once its created.

We can split it into three categories.

1. `General Constants` which defines repository name, base model and base resource.
2. `Creating and Updating` constants and methods.
3. `Listing` Constants and Methods.

Let's go in depth with each one.

## General Constants of the repository

Here we've `three` main constants that MUST BE defined for each repository.

1. `NAME` constant.
2. `MODEL` constant.
3. `RESOURCE` constant.

### Repository name

```php
    /**
     * Repository Name
     *
     * @const string
     */
    const NAME = 'users';
```

Here we defined the repository alias name that is used in the `config/mongez.php` file in repositories section.

### Repository Main Model

```php
    /**
     * Model class name
     *
     * @const string
     */
    const MODEL = User::class;
```

As a repository, it handles only one model for data insertion/update/delete or fetching, you can however work with more models in the declared methods.

In our example, it will be `App\Modules\Users\Models\User` model will be used here.

### Repository Main Resource

```php
    /**
     * Resource class name
     *
     * @const string
     */
    const RESOURCE = UserResource::class;
```

Declares the main resource class that will be used in the [Wrapping Methods](./base-manager#wrapping-methods) in data fetching.

## Creating and Updating constants and methods

The [Base Repository Manager](./base-manager) handles the `create` and `update` methods and provide us with easier and flexible constants and methods.

The following constants are used to map the create/update data.

- `DATA` constant
- `STRING_DATA` constant
- `INTEGER_DATA` constant
- `FLOAT_DATA` constant
- `BOOLEAN_DATA` constant
- `LOCALIZED_DATA` constant
- `UPLOADS` constant
- `LOCATION_DATA` constant
- `DATE_DATA` constant
- `ARRAYBLE_DATA` constant
- `WHEN_AVAILABLE_DATA` constant

### Storing/Updating Generic data

```php
    /**
     * Set the columns of the data that will be auto filled in the model
     * Please use the following data types for more convenient data types
     *
     * @const array
     */
    const DATA = [];
```

Starting from this section, we'll start distributing our data in constants for more convenient way of data insertion/update.

This `DATA` constant accepts any type of data that can be stored directly without any manipulation or handling.

:::warning Not recommended
This constant is not recommended to be used unless there are some generic data that has no certain type.
:::

:::tip Auto password encryption
If the constant array contains `password` column, it will be auto encrypted using the [bcrypt function](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/helpers#method-bcrypt).
:::

### Storing/Updating String data

```php
    /**
     * Set columns list of string values.
     *
     * @cont array
     */
    const STRING_DATA = ['name', 'email', 'password'];
```

Cast `name`, `email`, `password` inputs as `string value` in the create/update methods.

:::tip Auto password encryption
If the constant array contains `password` column, it will be auto encrypted using the [bcrypt function](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/helpers#method-bcrypt).
:::

### Storing/Updating integer data

```php
    /**
     * Set columns list of integers values.
     *
     * @cont array
     */
    const INTEGER_DATA = ['mobile_number'];
```

Cast `mobile_number` input as `interger value` in the create/update methods.

### Storing/Updating float Data

```php
    /**
     * Set columns list of float values.
     *
     * @cont array
     */
    const FLOAT_DATA = ['salary'];
```

Cast `salary` input as `float value` in the create/update methods.

### Storing/Updating boolean data

```php
    /**
     * Set columns of booleans data type.
     *
     * @cont array
     */
    const BOOLEAN_DATA = ['newsletter_subscribed'];
```

Cast `newsletter_subscribed` input as `boolean value` in the create/update methods.

:::info
If the boolean input is sent in he request as **false** in `string` it will be auto casted into `false as boolean` value.
:::

### Storing/Updating Localized Data

```php
    /**
     * Localized data
     *
     * @const array
     */
    const LOCALIZED_DATA = [];
```

This part of data is handled differently in each database engine, please refer to it in [MYSQL Repository](./mysql-repository-manager#localized-data) and [MongoDB Repository](./mongodb-repository-manager#localized-data)

### Storing/Updating Uploads

```php
    /**
     * Auto save uploads in this list
     *
     * If it's an indexed array, in that case the request key will be as database column name
     * If it's associated array, the key will be request key and the value will be the database column name
     *
     * It can be passed as well as an array of options, current options schema:
     * [
     *    'input' => 'string', // the input that will be read from the request files, if not present, it will be same as $column key
     *    'column' => 'string', // if not present, it will be same as $key key
     *    'clearable' => 'bool', // if set to true, the column value will be set to empty if there is no file to be uploaded
     *    'arrayable' => 'bool', // if set to true, it will be stored as an array, if set to null it auto determined
     * ]
     *
     * @const array
     */
    const UPLOADS = ['avatar'];
```

This constant handles data uploading and storing in database.

Uploading files system has simple to advanced features, let's see it step by step.

#### Uploading single/multiple files

`UPLOADS` constant accepts single file upload and multiple files upload, simply put the file column name and the managers will handle the two cases accordingly

:::info Storing multiple files
Based on your database engine the `multiple` uploads database storage is handled differently, in `MongoDB` the uploads are stored as an `array`, while `MYSQL` stored data as `json`.
:::

:::tip
This can be overriden by defining `SERIALIZE_MULTIPLE_UPLOADS` constant with a boolean value in your desired repositorty.

In `MYSQL`, the default value is `true`, while in `MongoDB`, the default value is `false`.
:::

```php
    /**
     * If set to true, the multiple uploads column paths will be json encoded while storing it in database.
     *
     * @const bool
     */
    const SERIALIZE_MULTIPLE_UPLOADS = false;
```

### Ignoreable by default

Any uploaded column is `Ignoreable` if there is no files uploaded in the update request.

If the model is being updated and there was a file uploaded in the creating step, for example user's avatar image is uploaded when user has created his/her accoumt, if user wants to update his/her profile and there is no avatar image is passed to the server, the avatar image will be remained the same old one.

### Configurable options for each single column

If you want to override default behavior for the previous options, you can override it by passing an array of options instead of the column name as follows:

```php
    /**
     * Auto save uploads in this list
     *
     * If it's an indexed array, in that case the request key will be as database column name
     * If it's associated array, the key will be request key and the value will be the database column name
     *
     * It can be passed as well as an array of options, current options schema:
     * [
     *    'input' => 'string', // the input that will be read from the request files, if not present, it will be same as $column key
     *    'column' => 'string', // if not present, it will be same as $key key
     *    'clearable' => 'bool', // if set to true, the column value will be set to empty if there is no file to be uploaded
     *    'arrayable' => 'bool', // if set to true, it will be stored as an array, if set to null it auto determined
     * ]
     *
     * @const array
     */
    const UPLOADS = [[
        'input' => 'coverPicture', // the request input name
        'column' => 'cover', // the column name in database
        'clearable' => true, // if there is no `converPircture` file in the request, the `cover` column will be cleared
        'arrayable' => false, // single file only
    ]];
```

### Storing/Updating geo location data

```php
    /**
     * Geo Location data
     *
     * @const array
     */
    const LOCATION_DATA = ['location'];
```

Store the location inputs as geo location data in the database.

> This is handled differently in `MYSQL` and `MongoDB` Databases.

### Storing/Updating date data

```php
    /**
     * Set columns list of date values.
     *
     * @cont array
     */
    const DATE_DATA = ['birth_date'];
```

Store `birth_date` in database as date, can be used for filtration using [Carbon](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/).

:::danger Declaring `$dates` property in the model
Any column defined in `DATE_DATA` constant must be defined in the `$dates` property in its corresponding model, otherwise searching by date won't work properly.
:::

```php title="App\Modules\Users\Models\User"
<?php
namespace App\Modules\Users\Models;

use HZ\Illuminate\Mongez\Database\Eloquent\MYSQL\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    protected $dates = ['birth_date'];
}
```

### Storing/Updating arrayable data

```php
    /**
     * Auto fill the following columns as arrays directly from the request
     * It will encoded and stored as `JSON` format,
     * it will be also auto decoded on any database retrieval either from `list` or `get` methods
     *
     * @const array
     */
    const ARRAYBLE_DATA = [];
```

This array stores the data as json in database, can be usful for bulk data such as `permissions` list.

:::info
For `MYSQL` database, the data is stored as json, in `MongoDB` it is stored as sent, array or object.
:::

### When available data and ignoring values

```php
    /**
     * Add the column if and only if the value is passed in the request, if set to true, it will ignore all changing all columns that is not in the request data.
     *
     * @cont array
     */
    const WHEN_AVAILABLE_DATA = [];
```

In all previous storage constants, if the column's value is not sent in the create or update method, the value will be cleared, unless the column is declared in the `WHEN_AVAILABLE_DATA`.

> the `UPLOADS` constant is the only constant ignoring empty values and does not clear the value.

Let's see an example for its usage:

```php title="UsersRepository"

    /**
     * Set columns list of string values.
     *
     * @cont array
     */
    const STRING_DATA = ['name', 'email'];
    /**
     * Add the column if and only if the value is passed in the request, if set to true, it will ignore all changing all columns that is not in the request data.
     *
     * @cont array
     */
    const WHEN_AVAILABLE_DATA = ['name'];
```

```php title="UsersController"
/**
 * Create new user
 *
 * @param  Request $request
 * @return Response
 */
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $user = $this->repository->create([
        'name' => 'Hasan',
        'email' => 'hassanzohdy@gmail.com'
    ]);

}
```

The user data will be **name** as `Hasan` and **email** as `hassanzohdy@gmail.com`.

```json
{
  "name": "Hasan",
  "email": "hassanzohdy@gmail.com"
}
```

Now let's update the user info

```php title="UsersController"
/**
 * Update user's info
 *
 * @param  int $id
 * @param  Request $request
 * @return Response
 */
public function update($id, Request $request)
{
    $user = $this->repository->update($id, [
        'email' => 'john@smith.com'
    ]);
}
```

Now the user data will be **name** as `Hasan` and **email** as `john@smith.com`.

```json
{
  "name": "Hasan",
  "email": "john@smith.com"
}
```

But what the email is not sent in the update process?

```php title="UsersController"
/**
 * Update user's info
 *
 * @param  int $id
 * @param  Request $request
 * @return Response
 */
public function update($id, Request $request)
{
    $user = $this->repository->update($id, [
        'name' => 'Mohammad'
    ]);
}
```

As the `email` is not ignorabe, it's value will be cleared, so the user data now will be **name** as `Ali` and **email** as `empty string`.

```json
{
  "name": "Mohammad",
  "email": ""
}
```

But if no data is sent at all?

```php title="UsersController"
/**
 * Update user's info
 *
 * @param  int $id
 * @param  Request $request
 * @return Response
 */
public function update($id, Request $request)
{
    $user = $this->repository->update($id, [
    ]);
}
```

The same applies, All columns will be checked if it is in the `WHEN_AVAILABLE_DATA` constant, in our example only the `name` is listed there.

So the user's data will be as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "Mohammad",
  "email": ""
}
```

#### Setting WHEN_AVAILABLE_DATA to `true`

If the `WHEN_AVAILABLE_DATA` is set to true, any column that has no value will be kept with its current value.

```php title="UsersRepository"

    /**
     * Set columns list of string values.
     *
     * @cont array
     */
    const STRING_DATA = ['name', 'email'];
    /**
     * Add the column if and only if the value is passed in the request, if set to true, it will ignore all changing all columns that is not in the request data.
     *
     * @cont array
     */
    const WHEN_AVAILABLE_DATA = true;
```

```php title="UsersController"
/**
 * Create new user
 *
 * @param  Request $request
 * @return Response
 */
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $user = $this->repository->create([
        'name' => 'Hasan',
        'email' => 'hassanzohdy@gmail.com'
    ]);

}
```

User data will be:

```json
{
  "name": "Hasan",
  "email": "hassanzohdy@gmail.com"
}
```

```php title="UsersController"
/**
 * Update user's info
 *
 * @param  int $id
 * @param  Request $request
 * @return Response
 */
public function update($id, Request $request)
{
    $user = $this->repository->update($id, []);
}
```

User data will remain the same as no values are passed to any column.

```json
{
  "name": "Hasan",
  "email": "hassanzohdy@gmail.com"
}
```

## Listing Constants

Now let's deep dive in our list constants.

Before we do so, let's take a peek about the normal `list` method

```php title="UsersController"
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $users = $this->repository->list([
        'active' => true,
    ]);
}
```

```php title="UsersRepository"
protected function filter()
{
    if ($this->option('active') === true) {
        $this->query->where('active', true);
    }
}
```

In this example, we sent an option called `active` to out `list` method, the `filter` method in the repository is called automatically if you're extending a `RepositoryManager`.

So to do our filter options, we use `filter` method, inside it we check if there are any sent `active` option and its value is set to **true**, if so then add the filter of `active` to be true using `$this->query` property.

This can be done easily using the magic `FILTER_BY` constant.

```php title="UsersRepository"
const FILTER_BY = [
    'bool' => ['active']
]
```

This will do exactly the same effect that we did in the `filter` method, except that we've added it in just an array.

The following constants are related to `list` method:

- `ORDER_BY` constant.
- `FILTER_BY` constant.
- `PAGINATE` constant.
- `ITEMS_PER_PAGE` constant.
- `DEFAULT_PUBLISHED_COLUMN` constant.
- `FILTERS` constant
